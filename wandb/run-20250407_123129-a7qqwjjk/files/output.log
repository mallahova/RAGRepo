Some weights of the model checkpoint at Alibaba-NLP/gte-multilingual-base were not used when initializing NewModel: ['classifier.bias', 'classifier.weight']
- This IS expected if you are initializing NewModel from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing NewModel from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
